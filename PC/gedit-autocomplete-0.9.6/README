gEdit Autocomplete suggests word completions based on the text in the active document
It first attempts to suggest compound words for a given word start, and only if such
words do not exist it resorts to suggesting simple words. 
Compond words consist of simple words joined via concatenators
The inbuild concatenators are targeting python and C++:  '.'  ':'  '->'  '::'  '://'  '@'

RegEx autocomplete:
Make sure there's a "whitespace" at the left of the cursor, 
then type a regular expression and hit <ALT>+"/"
To make your life easier, the regex search is case insensitive
Enjoy, you weirdos! :-))
